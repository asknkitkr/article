                Global spirits major Diageo is embarking on a mission to be a top performing consumer products company in India with sustained double-digit, profitable topline growth and it will rejig its portfolio as part of the exercise, according to a senior company official.
              </p>
              <p class="card-text">
                Having been on a "journey of holistic transformation" since completing acquisition of

United Spirits

NSE -1.34 % Ltd (USL) in 2013, marked by moderate topline growth, Diageo India is now looking forward to the new phase, while also creating an organisation of the future, and defining and executing an ambitious role for the company in the society.
              </p>
              <p class="card-text">
                "Our mission is to be a top performing consumer products company in India, delivering sustained double-digit, profitable topline growth, and long term value to all our stakeholders," Diageo India Managing Director & CEO Hina Nagarajan told PTI in an interview.
              </p>
              <p class="card-text">
                Elaborating on how the company aims to meet its goal, she said,"We will deliver our mission through three pillars that form the essence of our strategy -- a reshape of our portfolio while delivering our guidance of 'mid-to-high teens' margin, creating an organisation of the future and defining and executing an ambitious role for Diageo in the society."
              </p>
              <p class="card-text">
                When asked if the integration of USL is complete now and legacy issues have been addressed fully, Nagarajan said,"I think the integration is definitely over. I can't say all the legacy issues are over there are some which carry on but I think there is enough over now to let us focus on our goal of sustained double-digit growth. So we are on a new phase."

              <p class="card-text">
                In the second quarter ended September 30, 2021, USL posted a consolidated net profit of Rs 286.4 crore as compared to Rs 125.1 crore in the year-ago period. Consolidated revenue from operations was at Rs 8,208.8 crore as against Rs 7,509.4 crore in the same period last fiscal.

                In the first half of the fiscal (H1) ended September 30, 2021, it posted a consolidated net profit of Rs 336.7 crore.

              US consumer watchdog to review Big Tech data, promote lending competition
            </div>
            <div class="card-body">
              <p class="card-text">
                Washington: Chief consumer finance watchdog Rohit Chopra told US lawmakers on Wednesday his agency will review Big Tech's impact on the flow of money in the economy as leading technology firms use real-time consumer payments systems that collect huge amounts of personal data.
              </p>
              <p class="card-text">
                Chopra, head of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB), said Big Tech's entrance into the payment sector raises questions, including: "How will these firms harvest and monetise data they collect on our transactions? What criteria will they use to decide who is removed from the platform? How will they ensure that payment systems adhere to consumer protections?"
              </p>
              <p class="card-text">
                Chopra, a longtime consumer advocate tapped by Democratic President Joe Biden, outlined an ambitious agenda during his first of two congressional hearings this week as CFPB director. Wednesday's hearing before members of the House of Representatives Financial Services Committee will be followed by a Thursday sitting to testify before the Senate Banking panel.
              </p>
              <p class="card-text">
                "Many families continue to struggle to afford their mortgage and rent payments. Many small businesses are facing severe challenges to make ends meet," Chopra told the panel on Wednesday.
              </p>
              <p class="card-text">
                Chopra's hearing will likely reinvigorate the CFPB's status as a political lightning rod. Republicans have sought to handcuff the agency since its creation, calling it overpowerful and unaccountable.
              </p>
              <p class="card-text">
                Sworn in as the CFPB's full-time director earlier this month, Chopra built his name as a fierce defender of middle-class Americans at the Federal Trade Commission, and previously helped Senator Elizabeth Warren set up the CFPB after it was created in 2010.
              </p>
              <p class="card-text">
                That push for clarity is part of a growing interest among regulators and lawmakers about the rapid adoption of technology in various financial products, ranging from cryptocurrency to new "buy now, pay later" lending products.

              Pralhad Joshi reviews coal output; stresses on continuing momentum to dispatch maximum fuel to power plants
            </div>
            <div class="card-body">
              <p class="card-text">
                Coal Minister Pralhad Joshi on Tuesday reviewed coal production and stressed on continuing the momentum to dispatch maximum dry-fuel to thermal power plants. The development assumes significance in the wake of Coal India, which accounts for more than 80 per cent of domestic coal output, has been prioritising fuel supply temporarily to the power sector in view of the low stock position at thermal power plant.
              </p>
              <p class="card-text">
                "Held a follow-up meeting with senior officials of @CoalMinistry & @CoalIndiaHQ, post my recent visit to @secl_cil. Reviewed coal production, offtake and emphasized on continuing the momentum to dispatch maximum coal to thermal power plants," the minister said in a tweet.
              </p>
              <p class="card-text">
                Power Minister R K Singh on Monday exuded confidence that there will be no power shortage in the country amid the ongoing low coal stocks at power plants and stressed on timely payments by distribution companies to the plants for electricity supplied to them.
              </p>
              <p class="card-text">
                After the virtual launch of the green day market for sale of renewable energy on exchanges, Singh assured, "There won't be any back down...There was no (power) outage yesterday. There was no (power shortage) and it did not happen even before. If there is some outage, then that is because of our own (states') constraints."
              </p>
              <p class="card-text">
                The minister informed that power plants in the country have more than 8 million tonnes of coal at present.
              </p>
              <p class="card-text">
                According to the latest report of the Central Electricity Authority (CEA) which monitors 135 plants with over 165GW capacity, thermal projects had 8.1 million tonnes of coal on October 23, 2021, which is sufficient for four days (for these 135 plants).
              </p>
              <p class="card-text">
                Besides, the report showed as many as 49 non-pithead plants had less than four days or supercritical stock of dry fuel on Saturday compared to 62 such plants a week ago on October 16. This shows gradual improvement in the coal stock situation at thermal power plants in the country.

              Indian economy on path to swift recovery: Finance Ministry report
            </div>
            <div class="card-body">
              <p class="card-text">
                Strategic reforms and the rapid vaccination drive has placed the country on the path to swift recovery by enabling the economy to "navigate the ravaging waves" of the COVID-19 pandemic, according to the Finance Ministry's Monthly Economic Review.
              </p>
              <p class="card-text">
                Sustained and robust growth in agriculture, sharp rebound in manufacturing and industry, resumption of services activity and buoyant revenues suggest that the economy is progressing well, the September review said.
              </p>
              <p class="card-text">
                "India is well-placed on the path to swift recovery with growth impulses visibly transmitted to all sectors of the economy... Strategic reforms undertaken so far along with new milestones in vaccination drive have enabled the economy to navigate the ravaging waves of the COVID-19 pandemic," it said.
              </p>
              <p class="card-text">
                The external sector continues to offer bright prospects to India's growth revival as the country's merchandise exports crossed the USD 30-billion mark for the sixth consecutive month in fiscal year 2021-22, it said.
              </p>
              <p class="card-text">
                With merchandise trade deficit also rising in September, there is clear evidence of consumption and investment demand is also picking up in India, it said, adding, the external debt-to-GDP ratio continues to remain comfortable, declining to 20.2 per cent at the end-June 2021, from 21.1 per cent at the end-March 2021.
              </p>
              <p class="card-text">
                MIn tandem with growth impulses witnessed across the economy, the report said, the rate of growth of bank credit stood at 6.7 per cent YoY in the fortnight ending September 10, 2021 compared to 5.3 per cent in the corresponding period of the previous year.
              </p>
              <p class="card-text">
                With restoration of supply chains, improved mobility, and softening food inflation, consumer price index (CPI) inflation retreated to a four month-low of 5.3 per cent in August 2021, clearly demonstrating that inflationary tendencies are pandemic-induced and transitory.
