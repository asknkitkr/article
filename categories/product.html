                "Our mission is to be a top performing consumer products company in India, delivering sustained double-digit, profitable topline growth, and long term value to all our stakeholders," Diageo India Managing Director & CEO Hina Nagarajan told PTI in an interview.

                Elaborating on how the company aims to meet its goal, she said,"We will deliver our mission through three pillars that form the essence of our strategy -- a reshape of our portfolio while delivering our guidance of 'mid-to-high teens' margin, creating an organisation of the future and defining and executing an ambitious role for Diageo in the society."

                When asked if the integration of USL is complete now and legacy issues have been addressed fully, Nagarajan said,"I think the integration is definitely over. I can't say all the legacy issues are over there are some which carry on but I think there is enough over now to let us focus on our goal of sustained double-digit growth. So we are on a new phase."
