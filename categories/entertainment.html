                Hyperion', a project Cooper has had long in the works, will now be adapted as a feature film at Warner Bros Pictures and not a limited series at Syfy as it was previously conceived.

                Published by Bantam Spectra, the 'Hyperion Cantos' series is set 700 years after the death of Old Earth, where the entire galaxy is at war. Seven strangers set forth on a journey to unlock the mysteries of the planet Hyperion's Time Tombs -- each convinced that they alone carry the key to saving humanity.

              <p class="card-text">
                Cooper had a six-year deal with Todd Phillips and Warner Bros that concluded in 2019 with back-to-back commercial and critically acclaimed films like 'A Star Is Born' and 'Joker', fronted by Joaquin Phoenix.

                MUMBAI: Sam D’Souza, one of the persons mentioned in the affidavit submitted by Prabhakar Sail, a witness in the cruise drug bust case, has claimed in a television interview that Shah Rukh Khan’s manager Pooja Dadlani had paid money hoping to save the actor’s son Aryan from arrest, but the money was returned when they realised it was not possible.
              </p>
              <p class="card-text">
                D’Souza, a businessman, alleged that Dadlani had handed over Rs 50 lakh to K P Gosavi, a witness in the case, but when he realised that Gosavi was a “cheat”, he asked him to return the money to Dadlani.
              </p>
              <p class="card-text">
                Sail, in his affidavit, had mentioned that Gosavi, Dadlani and D’Souza had met early October 3. A person arrived in a car and handed over Sail two bags, which he took to D’Souza at Trident Hotel. D’Souza counted the money and said it was only Rs 38 lakh, the affidavit said. Sail claimed to have overheard a conversation where Gosavi and others discussed demanding Rs 25 crore, of which Rs 8 crore was to be paid to NCB zonal director Sameer Wankhede.

              <p class="card-text">
                “After much abuse and pressure, we managed to recover Rs 38 lakh from Gosavi, the rest we contributed and paid back to Dadlani and we understood that Gosavi was a cheat,” D’Souza told the TV channel.

                Comedian Tony Baker has been mourning the loss of his 21-year-old son, Cerain Baker, who died in a car accident, alongside two other individuals on August 3.

              <p class="card-text">
                According to E! News, a press release from the Burbank Police Department, authorities were called to the scene of a car crash at 11:50 p.m. on Tuesday night.
              </p>
              <p class="card-text">
                Upon arriving, the release stated, the police and paramedics determined that three passengers of a silver Volkswagen were ejected from the vehicle and died at the scene. The press release said that a fourth passenger was taken to a local hospital with "serious injuries." Additionally, a second vehicle was involved, but there was only one passenger, who was hospitalized with "serious injuries," according to authorities.
              </p>
              <p class="card-text">
                Investigators said they are investigating the crash after interviewing two passengers of a Mercedes Benz, who reported no injuries to the police. The press release stated that police believe the Mercedes Benz was "racing" the Kia when they collided with the Volkswagen.
              </p>
              <p class="card-text">
                Tony and Cerain's mother, Cherie Whitehead, spoke to a news outlet about the accident on Thursday. Tony told the newscasters, "It feels like it's not real. We get waves of grief. We sob uncontrollably. Then it's back to regular conversation."
              </p>
              <p class="card-text">

              Wanted to build my character organically: Dave Davis on playing Hasidic Jew in 'The Vigil'
            </div>
            <div class="card-body">
              <p class="card-text">
                Actor Dave Davis, the star of "The Vigil", said he didn't succumb to stereotypes while playing a grief stricken Jewish man in the horror movie. "The Vigil", which comes from debutante filmmaker Keith Thomas, is set in Brooklyn's ultra-orthodox Hasidic Jewish community.
              </p>
              <p class="card-text">
                It follows a man, named Yakov Ronen, who is tasked to sit as a Shomer, the ritualistic practice of looking after a dead body over the course of one night. But during the course of the night, he is targeted by a malevolent spirit known as a Mazzik.
              </p>
              <p class="card-text">
                Davis, who previously made appearances in movies such as "The Big Short", "Logan" and "Greyhound", said he instantly agreed to do the film when Thomas sent him the script.
              </p>
              <p class="card-text">
                "When I started really trying to live in the character of Yakov, it came with a number of difficulties. He is struggling and has mental health issues. He lives with a lot of guilt and fear. He comes from a culture that I didn't know and wasn't familiar with.
              </p>
              <p class="card-text">
                "I had to learn about it. Plus, he sounds very different to myself. He has an accent and English is not his first language. So all those things were the beginning of me trying to piece together who Yakov is. And over time trying to organically build this character," Davis told PTI in an interview.
              </p>
              <p class="card-text">
                The actor, who is in his early 30s, said he made sure his performance as Yakov didn't look like an impression.
              </p>
              <p class="card-text">
                "I never wanted to do an impression. I never want it to be copying something that I thought was how Yakov was supposed to sound. I wanted to build it organically so that Yakov had the luxury of being his own person, his own character.
              </p>
              <p class="card-text">
                "So I was sitting alone in this apartment and was imagining things in corners. I was trying to get into the mindset of someone who is seeing things and who's afraid of their own health. And who's afraid of their own safety. And it was a very painful place to live in," he added

              Salman Khan opens up on how it feels with Antim going houseful
            </div>

                Post the second lockdown the Akshay Kumar film Sooryavanshi was the first to hit screens. Despite the risks being high, the film did rather well at the box office. A couple of weeks on, and the Salman Khan – Aayush Sharma film Antim: The Final Truth has hit screens to an appreciative response from critics and fans. Following the film’s good opening, Salman Khan was interacting with the media to celebrate the success of Antim. During the interaction, Salman spoke about how easy it has become to attain a houseful board thanks to the restricted occupancy due to Covid restrictions.
              </p>
              <p class="card-text">
                Talking about how he feels with Antim – The Final Truth going houseful Salman Khan added, “It is a good feeling, I think the first time a Houseful board was put up it was for Wanted. And since then there has always been a Houseful board for my films. It feels good when you hear people say, 'hum gaye ticket lene, par yaar houseful tha'. I am very fortunate that at such a time as well, my film has featured a houseful board.”
              </p>
              <p class="card-text">
                Further talking about how easy it has become now for films to go houseful, the actor continued, “In case it was full seating capacity, and despite that there was a houseful board, then it would that much more better. But now with 50% capacity, it has become slightly easier to achieve a houseful board, at least that’s what I think”. Salman was more than clear to pinpoint that his releases have been enjoying the houseful tag even before the lockdown and pandemic.
