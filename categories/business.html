            </div>

              <p class="card-text">
                Car market leader Maruti Suzuki India on Wednesday said it sold around 13,000 units on the day of Dhanteras, lower than last year hampered by supply constraints due to semiconductor shortage, although Tata Motors stated its deliveries grew 94%.
              </p>
              <p class="card-text">
                Automobile dealers' body FADA on Tuesday termed the current festive season the worst in terms of business in a decade for its retail partners across the country as chip shortage impacted supplies in passenger vehicles creating a huge shortage of vehicles in SUV, compact - SUV and luxury segment.
              </p>
              <p class="card-text">"Demand and bookings have been good. We tried our best to deliver as many vehicles as possible. However due to supply side constraints we closed a little lower than last year, at around 13,000 units," Maruti Suzuki India Senior Executive Director (Marketing & Sales) Shashank Srivastava told PTI.</p>
              <p class="card-text">On the other hand, homegrown auto major Tata Motors had a good day on Dhanteras on Tuesday.</p>
              <p class="card-text">On the auspicious day of Dhanteras, our deliveries nearly doubled as compared to last year, owing to strong demand for our 'New Forever' range, including the newly launched Punch and the EVs. Across India, our deliveries grew by 94 per cent," Tata Motors President, Passenger Vehicles Business Unit Shailesh Chandra said.</p>
              <p class="card-text">He, however, did not disclose the exact sales number for the day.</p>
              <p class="card-text">Multi-brand certified used car company, Mahindra First Choice Wheels Ltd said it delivered a record 1,028 units on Dhanteras through its over 1,100 dealerships across more than 300 cities in India.</p>
              <p class="card-text">"This year's festive season has been remarkable as the brand has registered 40 per cent growth. We are overwhelmed with the traction on our e-commerce platform which has contributed 25 per cent to our overall sales during this festive period," Mahindra First Choice Wheels Managing Director and CEO Ashutosh Pandey said in a statement.</p>
              <p class="card-text">On the outlook, he said,"We are sure that this demand will continue to surge till the end of the financial year and we look forward to supporting the consumers to find their vehicles through our strong online and offline channels."</p>

              US blacklists Israel's NSO Group, the maker of Pegasus spyware
            </div>
            <div class="card-body">
              <p class="card-text">The U.S. Commerce Department added Israel's NSO Group and Candiru to its trade blacklist on Wednesday, saying they sold spyware to foreign governments that used the equipment to target government officials, journalists and others.</p>
              <p class="card-text">Positive Technologies of Russia, and Computer Security Initiative Consultancy PTE. LTD, from Singapore, were also listed. The Department said they trafficked in cyber tools used to gain unauthorized access to computer networks</p>
              <p class="card-text">The companies' addition to the list, for engaging in activities contrary to U.S. national security or foreign policy interests, means that exports to them from U.S counterparts are restricted. It for instance makes it far harder for U.S.</p>
              <p class="card-text">In the past, the NSO Group and Candiru have been accused of selling hacking tools to authoritarian regimes. NSO says it only sells its products to law enforcement and intelligence agencies and takes steps to curb abuse.</p>
              <p class="card-text">The Biden administration imposed sanctions on Positive Technologies, a Russian cybersecurity firm, this year for providing support to Russian security services. The company has denied any wrongdoing.</p>
              <p class="card-text">Spokespeople for Positive Technologies and Computer Security Initiative Consultancy PTE. LTD, also known as COSEINC, did not immediately respond to requests for comment.</p>

              Larsen & Toubro gains 4%, hits record high on hopes of strong order inflows
            </div>
            <div class="card-body">
              <p class="card-text">Shares of Larsen & Toubro (L&T) rallied 4.3 per cent, hitting a record high of Rs 1,895 on the BSE in Wednesday’s intra-day trade on expectation of strong orders inflows as the management indicated tender pipeline remains strong at Rs 6.83 trillion, largely from infra and Hydrocarbon.</p>
              <p class="card-text">The stock of construction & engineering giant surpassed its previous high of Rs 1,884.90 touched on October 19, 2021. In past one week, the stock has gained 6 per cent, after the company posted a healthy operational performance for the quarter ended September 2021 (Q2FY22). The company’s order backlog remains strong at Rs 3.3 trillion. In comparison, the S&P BSE Sensex was down 1.5 per cent during the same period.</p>
              <p class="card-text">L&T said it bagged orders worth Rs 42,140 crore during Q2FY22, registering a robust growth of 50 per cent compared with the corresponding period of the previous year. Orders were received in various segments like oil & gas, metros, rural water supply, minerals and metal, public space and power transmission and distribution. The International orders at Rs 22,116 crore during the quarter comprised 52 per cent of the total order inflow, the company said.</p>
              <p class="card-text">Given the strong order backlog and tender pipeline, management has maintained its low-to-mid teen revenue and order inflow growth for FY22. According to analysts, the execution run rate at infra sites is naturally expected to pick up as covid-impact recedes and capex cycle domestically picks up.</p>

              World oil prices drops as data shows big build in United State inventory
            </div>
            <div class="card-body">
              <p class="card-text">Oil prices fell on Wednesday as industry data pointed to a big build in crude oil and distillate stocks in the United States, the world's largest oil consumer, and as pressure mounted on OPEC to increase supply</p>
              <p class="card-text">Brent crude futures fell 71 cents, or 0.9%, to $84.00 a barrel by 0450 GMT, after dropping to a session-low of $83.27 earlier.</p>
              <p class="card-text">U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures tumbled $1.10, or 1.3%, to $82.81 a barrel, after dropping to a low of $82.26 earlier.</p>
              <p class="card-text">"Crude prices are declining after the API reported the sixth straight week of crude oil inventory builds and as the Biden administration exhausts every possible plea to OPEC+ members before tapping their Strategic Petroleum Reserve," said Edward Moya, senior analyst at OANDA</p>
              <p class="card-text">"World leaders are running out of cards to pressure OPEC+ and that should mean whatever dip that comes from tapping strategic reserves from China or the US will likely be bought into."</p>
              <p class="card-text">President Joe Biden, speaking at a climate summit in Glasgow, blamed a surge in oil and gas prices on a refusal by OPEC nations to pump more crude.</p>
