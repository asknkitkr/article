              The Paradoxical Prime Minister
            </div>
            <div class="card-body">
              <p class="card-text">
                Narendra Modi is a paradoxical man. He says one thing and does another.
              </p>
              <p class="card-text">
                He gives voice to a number of liberal ideas (such as the constitution being his holy book, and sab ka saath, sab ka vikas), while at the same time pandering to some of the most illiberal elements in Indian society, on whom he depends for political support.
              </p>
              <p class="card-text">
                Another paradox is how a Prime Minister who prides himself on effective governance has, through his silence, appeared to condone the worst aspects of misgovernance—communal riots, lynchings, the violence of gau-rakshaks and so on.
              </p>
              <p class="card-text">
                A third paradox is his talk of soaring ambitions for the country when his government’s performance is underwhelming.
              </p>
              <p class="card-text">
                A noble, selfless leader who acts effectively in the interests of all his countrymen or an autocratic, right-wing bigot who is interested only in power and converting plural India into a Hindu Rashtra? Or something in between?
              </p>
              <p class="card-text">
                The book is divided into five sections comprising fifty chapters. The first section takes a close look at Modi’s life and times. The other four sections look at key aspects of the way in which Modi’s government functions and the lasting and often deleterious impact it has had on Indian society, major institutions, the economy, foreign policy, and our fundamental values.

              The Great Gatsby
            </div>
            <div class="card-body">
              <p class="card-text">
                Charles Scribner's Sons published The Great Gatsby on April 10, 1925.[132] Fitzgerald cabled Perkins the day after publication to monitor reviews: "Any news?"[132] "Sales situation doubtful [but] excellent reviews", read a telegram from Perkins on April 20.[133] Fitzgerald responded on April 24, saying the cable dispirited him, closing the letter with "Yours in great depression".[133] Fitzgerald soon received letters from contemporaries Willa Cather, Edith Wharton, and poet T. S. Eliot praising the novel.[134] Although gratified by such correspondence, Fitzgerald sought public acclaim from professional critics.

              <p class="card-text">
                The Great Gatsby received generally favorable reviews from literary critics of the day.[136] Edwin Clark of The New York Times felt the novel was a mystical and glamorous tale of the Jazz Age.[137] Similarly, Lillian C. Ford of the Los Angeles Times hailed the novel as a revelatory work of art that "leaves the reader in a mood of chastened wonder".[138] The New York Post described Fitzgerald's prose style as scintillating and genuinely brilliant.[139] The New York Herald Tribune was less impressed, referring to The Great Gatsby as "a literary lemon meringue" that nonetheless "contains some of the nicest little touches of contemporary observation you could imagine—so light, so delicate, so sharp".[140] In The Chicago Daily Tribune, H. L. Mencken judged the work's plot to be highly improbable, although he praised the writing as elegant and the "careful and brilliant finish".

              Mein Kampf
            </div>
            <div class="card-body">
              <p class="card-text">
                There was a lot said last week about the reëmergence, in Germany, of Adolf Hitler’s “Mein Kampf” (“My Struggle”)—which just became legal to publish and sell there, for the first time since the end of the Second World War, albeit in a heavily hedged “scholarly” edition. Did provide a public place for the autobiographical testament of the Nazi dictator, written when he was briefly imprisoned in Bavaria, in the nineteen-twenties, in some way legitimize it, people asked, even if the text was surrounded by a trench work of scholarly addenda designed to italicize its lies and manias?
              </p>
              <p class="card-text">
                I read “Mein Kampf” right through for the first time last year, while working on a piece about Timothy Snyder’s history of the Holocaust as it happened in the Slavic and Baltic states during the Second World War. (Snyder reads Hitler in a somewhat original and provocative way, derived in part from his reading of “Mein Kampf.”) I read it in the first English translation, from 1933, with the German version alongside, online, and a crib of graduate-school German grammar nearby. (I’ve since reread sections, in Ralph Manheim’s later translation.) The question of what to do with “Mein Kampf” is, in some sense, independent of the book’s contents—buying it is a symbolic act before it’s any kind of intellectual one, and you can argue that it’s worth banning on those grounds alone. A good opposing case can be made on similarly symbolic grounds: that making it public in Germany is a way of robbing it of the glamour of the forbidden.

              Rich Dad Poor Dad
            </div>
            <div class="card-body">
              <p class="card-text">
                When I first discovered Rich Dad, Poor Dad, I was well into the last year of my residency. I couldn’t put it down, and I’m not exaggerating when I say that it completely changed my life. It was also probably the first non-medical book I had read since I was introduced to the works of Malcolm Gladwell during medical school.
              </p>
              <p class="card-text">
                The ideas presented in Rich Dad, Poor Dad aren’t particularly profound or fancy, but the concepts were entirely new to me. This is especially true of how the book taught me to think of money not as an end-goal, but as a tool for wealth creation.
              </p>
              <p class="card-text">
                Up until that point, I had thought that all I needed to do was to find the right job and I’d be set. After all, this was exactly the way I’d thought about getting into the right medical school, the right residency, and the right fellowship (haha).

But after reading this book, I realized that the concept of trading time for money just isn’t the smartest way to go through life. Your money should work for you—not the other way around.

              Ian McEwan - The Cockroach
            </div>
            <div class="card-body">
              <p class="card-text">
                It’s been difficult to miss Ian McEwan. The Cockroach, his satirical new Brexit novella, is his second book this year and his third in three years. The Cockroach is so toothless and wan that it may drive his readers away in long apocalyptic caravans. The young McEwan, the author of blacker-than-black little novels, the man who acquired the nickname ‘Ian Macabre,’ would rather have gnawed off his own fingers than written it. At dark political and social moments, we need better, rougher magic than this
              </p>
              <p class="card-text">
                McEwan is hardly a dummy; he derives more than a few witty-ish moments from his premise. The best arrive early … Once McEwan has established his premise, however, The Cockroach stalls. It devolves into self-satisfied, fish-in-barrel commentary about topics like Twitter and the tabloid press. The literary references…are plummy and tortured … The idea of writing The Cockroach probably seemed, in the shower one morning, like a good one. Later, after coffee, it might have occurred to McEwan that suggesting your opponents are cockroaches might be to drop down to their carpet level.
